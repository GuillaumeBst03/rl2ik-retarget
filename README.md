# RL → IK → Motion Retargeting (Toy Project)

Minimal research project exploring:
- Reinforcement Learning in simulation
- Inverse Kinematics as optimization
- Motion retargeting across morphologies

Target: preparation for a robotics research internship.

## Structure
- src/envs: simulation environments
- src/models: RL training & rollout
- src/robotics: kinematics, IK, retargeting
- src/viz: visualization
